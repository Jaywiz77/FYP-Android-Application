This repository is solely reserved for the Android Application. More info about the branching strategy can be found below.

## Branching strategy

1. Each person should create their own branch for individual feature
2. Once done with a feature, submit a pull request to master and Grace (QA) will check the code before acceptingthe merge
3. In the case the codes are strongly correlated with another feature, create another branch out from the sub-branch so that work can be continued while QA is checking, else create another branch from master
